## Purpose

This repository serves as a centralized location for technical documentation, configuration guides, and system administration notes.

## License

Private repository - for personal use only
## Conventional Commits & Hooks

Documentation updates also follow Conventional Commits for consistency.

- Global Commit Template: configured to `Documents/dev/dotfiles/git-templates/commit_template.txt`.
- Shared Hooks: `core.hooksPath` â†’ `Documents/dev/dotfiles/githooks`.
  - `pre-commit`: blocks obvious secrets and large files; use `.githooks-allow.txt` to allow known safe paths.
  - `commit-msg`: validates Conventional Commit format; bypass with `GITHOOKS_BYPASS=1` if necessary.

## CI Checks

- Link Check (lychee) and Secret Scan (gitleaks) run on pushes and PRs; scheduled weekly.
- Markdownlint runs for all Markdown files; see `.markdownlint.jsonc` for exceptions.

## Assistant Guides

- See `Documents/dev/CODEX.md` and `Documents/dev/CLAUDE.md` for the shared workspace context and conventions.

## Review Routing

- CODEOWNERS is set to `@emeraldocean123`; PRs route reviews automatically.

## Contributing

- Use Conventional Commits for all messages: `type(scope)?: subject`.
- Commit Template: this repo is configured with a commit message template to guide messages.
- Hooks: shared `pre-commit` and `commit-msg` hooks run automatically (configured via global `core.hooksPath`).
- Bypass (rare): set `GITHOOKS_BYPASS=1` to skip checks once.
## Shared Resources

All script references now point to the centralized helpers in `~/Documents/dev/shared`. Update that repository first to ensure the validation and SSH utilities referenced throughout this documentation are available.
