2. **Sources Update**: Changed `bookworm` → `trixie` in `/etc/apt/sources.list`
3. **Non-interactive Upgrade**: `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt full-upgrade -y`
4. **Service Verification**: Checked all applications post-upgrade
5. **Python Testing**: Verified Python 3.13 compatibility

## Post-Upgrade Actions

- [x] All containers upgraded to Debian 13
- [x] All services verified working
- [x] Python 3.13 compatibility confirmed
- [x] Network connectivity maintained
- [x] SSH access working on all containers

## Notes

- **Syncthing**: Service configuration may need minor adjustment but application runs correctly
