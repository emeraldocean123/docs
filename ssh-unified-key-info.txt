--- DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS ---

1. In Bitwarden:
   - Create new item type "SSH Key"
   - Name: "Unified SSH Key - All Systems"
   - Copy private and public keys to respective fields
   - Add fingerprint to notes

2. Deployment Status: ✅ COMPLETED
   All systems have been configured with the unified SSH key.

3. Systems using this key (14 total):
   ✅ GitHub repositories (emeraldocean123) - SSH key auth
   ✅ NixOS MSI GE75 Raider laptop (192.168.1.106) - user: joseph
   ✅ NixOS HP dv9500 Pavilion laptop (192.168.1.104) - user: joseph
   ✅ CachyOS HP dv9500 Pavilion (192.168.1.104) - user: joseph
   ✅ Proxmox VE host (192.168.1.40) - user: root
   ✅ OPNsense router VM (192.168.1.1) - user: root

--- USER STRATEGY ---

Personal Devices (user: joseph):
- NixOS laptops: Standard user account for daily use
- Synology NAS: Personal account with admin privileges

Infrastructure/Servers (user: root):
- Proxmox host: Root access for hypervisor management
- All LXC containers: Root access for service administration
- OPNsense router: Root access for network configuration (FreeBSD standard)

This approach follows security best practices:
- Non-root access on personal devices
- Root access on infrastructure for administration
- Consistent with each platform's conventions

--- SYSTEMS WITH SSH DISABLED ---

❌ TP-Link SG3428-2 switch (192.168.1.2):
- SSH disabled (connection auto-closes, not usable)
- Managed via Omada controller web interface
- Ed25519 keys not supported (would require RSA + TFTP setup)
- Web management via Omada at https://192.168.1.52:8043

--- SYSTEMS WITHOUT SSH ACCESS ---

❌ Linksys MX4200 router (192.168.1.5):
- Consumer-grade mesh WiFi system
- No native SSH support (port 22 closed)
- Web management only via https://192.168.1.5
- Would require custom firmware (OpenWrt) for SSH access
- Not recommended due to warranty void and complexity

❌ Reolink NVR (192.168.1.20):
- No official SSH/telnet support (port 22 closed)
- Web management via http://192.168.1.20
- Community has requested SSH/SFTP but not implemented by vendor
- Hardware modification possible but unsupported

❌ Epson ET-3830 printer (192.168.1.21):
- Consumer printer with no CLI access
- No SSH/telnet support (port 22 closed)
- Management via control panel, Epson Smart Panel app, or UPnP
- Limited web interface (404 on root path)

❌ Consumer/IoT devices (no SSH capability):
- Google Nest Thermostat (192.168.1.107) - App management only
- Roomba vacuum (192.168.1.139) - App management only

--- DOCUMENTED COMPUTERS ---

✅ HP dv9500 Pavilion laptop (192.168.1.104):
- NixOS with unified SSH key (user: joseph)
- CachyOS dual boot with unified SSH key (user: joseph)

✅ MSI GE75 Raider laptop (192.168.1.106):
- NixOS with unified SSH key (user: joseph)
- CachyOS dual boot with unified SSH key (user: joseph)

➖ Alienware 18 Area 51 (192.168.1.197):
